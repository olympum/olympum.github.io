I wrote about this header a little while ago in my <a title="Onesoup"
href="http://www.onesoup.com/blog/imps-is-dead-long-live-xmpp/">onesoup
blog</a>, but since I have received various emails from folks asking
me whether I'd continue or not with onesoup. Basically, they all make
the point that there is a latent customer base on old phones with the
native client.

So the question really becomes: even if IMPS is a lagging technology,
even if operators are unfriendly, even if nobody knows how to monetize
IM, ... the penetration of these clients is huge. And users seem to be
waking up. So, is there really a blooming market here, especially in
emerging countries?
