AOL has published the protocol powering both AIM and ICQ (code-named
OSCAR). Although the protocol was already well known through reverse
engineering, even if it's significantly more complex and chatty than
MSN's or YMSG, this is really good news since it formalizes AOL
supporting third party clients, including Yamigo. Additionally,
besides publishing the protocol documentation, AOL has released an <a

SDK for C/C++ and Java</a>, and the ability for creating protocol
plugins that can even be monetized through revenue-sharing with AOL.
Altogether, a good move from AOL.
