I have been very much silent on my blog for the last 6 weeks. The reason has been me changing jobs to become Yahoo's Chief Architect of International Engineering. The first weeks at work have been absolutely thrilling and I am highly delighted to be working in such an amazingly skilled and enthusiastic team. I really look forward at the challenge ahead. Unfortunately being able to take on this challenge requires absolute dedication, and my ability to blog will be somehow more limited than in the past. So if you are a usual reader, please bear with me for a little longer: posts will be coming back in no time.
