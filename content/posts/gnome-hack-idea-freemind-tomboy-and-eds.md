I take notes in meetings using <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">FreeMind</a>. Every time I identify a task I  mark the node down using an icon and after the meeting I follow up creating the necessary tasks in <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/evolution/">Evolution</a>. I would like to be able to link my mindmaps to tasks in Evolution. Hopefully it can be done using FreeMind, or perhaps we need to invest in <a href="http://www.psycho-project.org/index.html">Psycho</a> or something similar tighter to the Gnome desktop. If we decide not to use FreeMind, the tool of choice should use FreeMind's XML schema to ensure interoperability with folks running other desktops.

<p>Sometimes there is a node in the mindmap I would like to expand into a <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/tomboy/">Tomboy</a> desktop wiki page. Right now, I have to create the node on Tomboy and write down a reference in the mindmap with the URL to the wiki page.</p>
<p>Sometimes I am writing in Tomboy and I identify tasks required to follow up the note. I would like to create a wiki link to the task in EDS.</p>
<p>And of course, I would like to see my tasks in EDS, and be able to link back to FreeMind and Tomboy.</p>
<p>Microsoft Office has a similar feature.</p>
<p>How do we do that for the Gnome world?</p>
