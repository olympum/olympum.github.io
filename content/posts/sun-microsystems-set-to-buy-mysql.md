This is truly amazing. Sun and Oracle are set to buy all letters on
the LAMP stack, with now <a
href="http://mysql.com/news-and-events/sun-to-acquire-mysql.html">Sun
buying MySQL for 1 billion dollars</a> (thanks Pascal for the ping).
Maybe now Monty and David will start competing with <a
href="http://gadgets.fosfor.se/rising-sun-larry-ellisons-yacht/">Larry
Ellison's extravagant yacht department</a>. Seriously, 1 billion
dollars is a record price for any open source company. Will Oracle now
finally buy RedHat to put pressure on SUN?

<p>I am hoping to see the JAVA ticker symbol company improve MySQL support, and licensing, for Java. Since, honestly, right now it sucks so much that one would say the only viable RDBMS alternative for Linux and Java is Oracle (please don't get me started with DB2).</p>
