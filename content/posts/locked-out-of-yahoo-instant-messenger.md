I have been using Yahoo! IM since 1999, but unable to log onto it over the last couple of years because of my employer's URL filtering system and firewall settings. It seems like my account has been deactivated by Yahoo! Customer Service.

<p>My trouble is that I have lost all my contacts! Anybody, how do I get these back?</p>
