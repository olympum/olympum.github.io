Latest benchmark results on WebSphere 6.0.1 seem to indicate that SOAP/HTTP outperforms  RMI/IIOP. Interesting, it makes me wonder if the reason comes down to IBM abandoning CORBA and placing the best developers on the SOA field. Otherwise there is really no other explanation I can think of. I'll have to instrument some code to understand the why.
