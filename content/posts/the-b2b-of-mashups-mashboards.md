I came some time ago across an interesting buzzword, <a href="http://software.silicon.com/applications/0,39024653,39162389,00.htm">mashboards</a>, which is really starting to show that at the end of the day what really matters is systems integration. Where we had mashups in the B2C world, we now have mashboards in the B2B world.

<p>Mashboards will become a flourishing area for SaaS. They target the SMB market and address exactly the customer pain. I can see how we'll be hearing about SOA for web in no time, or web-driven business processes, ... Let's wait and see how the analysts call this one. For the time being I'll call them mashboards.</p>
