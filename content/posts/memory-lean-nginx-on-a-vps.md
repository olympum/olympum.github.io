I spent this weekend testing and installing nginx and I have said Adios to Apache! Let me tell you why I have done that.

<p>I am running this blog on a <a href="https://manage.slicehost.com/customers/signup?referrer=49029804">slicehost.com</a> 256Mb Xen VPS, using WordPress. I have been using Apache 2.2 for almost a year now without any problems. But recently I deployed a little Ruby on Rails application using mongrel for my wife's business, and then suddenly I ran out of memory.  Each Apache worker was easily taking 15 to 20Mb, even with a really cut-down configuration and built on Gentoo. With three Mongrel backends and the MySQL server I was starting to swap to disk.</p>
<p>I tried FastCGI instead of Mongrel, but it only cut down from about 50Mb to 40Mb for each process, not enough really to make a difference.  I had to trim the fat out of the web server.</p>
<p>So  about dropping Apache. First I considered Pound as a load balancer, but given that I would also still need a web server for static content in Rails (not wanting to serve that with Mongrel) I decided to look for alternatives.</p>
<p>Lighty and FastCGI tests did not even complete, so I gave up on Lighty. The FastCGI processes were becoming Zombie for some unknown reason.</p>
<p>Then I tried nginx. I have 5 workers, each consuming around 3Mb. Wow ... I call that Spring savings.</p>
<p>nginx is sending all blog traffic to a couple of php-cgi handlers. I tried both TCP and Unix sockets, but went for TCP since I was getting dropped requests and stalling processes for Unix sockets. php-cgi is not very fast, but it's stable and it has a reduced memory footprint.</p>
<p>Then nginx is acting as a reverse proxy and balancing across 3 Mongrels. I tried also FastCGI, but again it's not stable.</p>
<p>And man is this thing flying or what!? I have enough memory spare to make MySQL happy. Plus I am caching a lot of Rails generated content that nginx serves happily.</p>
<p>Now, some numbers from Apache Benchmark (running on Linux 2.6.16.29-xen #3 SMP, x86_64 Dual Core AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 265 AuthenticAMD GNU/Linux, Xen host with 256Mb):<br />
nginx + pure HTML content:</p>

<p>Sure, it's not a scientific test by any means, but it tells you something. And so far, no complains. If I ever outgrow the server, I can always get Pound on front of a couple of nginx web servers.</p>
